Various Algorithms Implementation--Happy Learning..!!!!

## DATA PREPRATION
1. Data Cleaning: Identifying and correcting mistakes or errors in the data.
2. Feature Selection: Identifying those input variables that are most relevant to the task.
3. Data Transforms: Changing the scale or distribution of variables.
4. Feature Engineering: Deriving new variables from available data.
5. Dimensionality Reduction: Creating compact projections of the data.


## STATASTICS
For every data scientist it is very important to know the data insight before giving findigs of data and for that data analysis is very important.
Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data.
There are two types of statistics:
1. Descriptive statistics describes data (for example, a chart or graph) 
  * Central tendency : Mean,Median,Mode
  * Dispersion : Range,Variance,Standard deviation
  * Skewness : Distribution graph
2. Inferential statistics allows you to make predictions (“inferences”) from that data. With inferential statistics, you take data from samples and make generalizations about a population.
  * Regression Analysis: Regression analysis describes the relationship between a set of independent variables and a dependent variable. This analysis incorporates hypothesis tests that help determine whether the relationships observed in the sample data actually exist in the population.
  * Confidence Interval : Calculating population parameters is almost always unknowable. So we calculate sample parameter that we can be confident that the real population mean falls within this range .Confidence intervals incorporate the uncertainty and sample error to create a range of values the actual population value is like to fall within. 
  * Hypothesis testing : A statistical hypothesis is a hypothesis that is testable on the basis of observed data modelled as the realised values taken by a collection of random variables.
