# Advanced Finetuning Techniques
This repository provides examples of advanced finetuning techniques for machine learning models. These techniques can help you optimize hyperparameters for your models and improve their performance.

## Techniques
The following techniques are covered in this repository:

**1. Optuna:** A hyperparameter optimization framework that uses Bayesian optimization to efficiently search for optimal hyperparameters.

**2. GridSearchCV:** A traditional method for hyperparameter tuning that exhaustively searches over a specified hyperparameter grid.

**3. Hyperopt:** A hyperparameter optimization library that uses tree-structured Parzen estimators to model the hyperparameter search space.

Each technique is implemented in a separate file in this repository, with its own README file that explains how to use it.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required to run the examples in this repository:

* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* optuna
* hyperopt
